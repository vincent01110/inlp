Pitchfork;Kendrick Lamar is a giddy dramatist. He loves to pack his music with perspectives, personifying his many characters and muses with distinct voices, cadences, and beat switches that bring them to life. Those virtuosic tics have made him one of rap’s most celebrated storytellers and stylists, he is the first and only rapper to have won a Pulitzer Prize. For some, Kendrick’s elastic narration and indignant dispatches on Black life have made him a figure of supreme moral authority in hip-hop—a role he spurns on his fifth studio album. Kendrick spends Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers gleefully immolating his cherished reputation, swinging between caustic taunts and plaintive confessions over slick funk and soul production that gleams like shards of a mirror. The double album offers rap’s most jarring heel turn since Future cut loose on Monster, taking an unfocused but probing look at Kendrick’s most elusive character: himself. Five years have passed since Kendrick released the punchy and vivid Damn. and curated the easygoing soundtrack for Black Panther—eons in the rap world, and quite a chunk of regular time too. Aside from the splashy launch of pgLang, his opaque media company with Dave Free, and a few scattered features, Kendrick has kept a low profile. His final album for his longtime label home Top Dawg Entertainment enters a world shaped by the pandemic, #MeToo, and the global protests against police brutality, events Kendrick comments on across the record while recounting how he’s spent his hiatus. His main priority, however, is clarifying who, exactly, Kendrick Lamar represents.  The short answer is his family and his homies. The search for the longer answer propels the album. Prompted by narrator Whitney Alford, his romantic partner since high school, Kendrick opens the record by framing his honesty as dangerous, the first of many disclosures to come. I been goin’ through somethin’/Be afraid, he says, a warning that is followed by frantic double-time verses that slink around oblique piano stabs and brisk drums. His rapping jerks and lurches as he reveals he’s going to therapy and wracked by grief and shame, feelings that he copes with through luxury purchases and infidelity. Even as he details a specific fling, his storytelling frays, held together by the repetition of his paramour’s eye color rather than mise-en-scène or dense rhyme.  Throughout Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, Kendrick seems to actively reject the elegance and structure of past songs like Duckworth. and Good Kid, writing in quick strokes and sketches that channel his messy admissions. Ideas scamper around like field rabbits and he avoids clean hooks, denying the listener easy access to his thoughts. It verges on antipop. His flows streak across Count Me Out, bouncing off the kick drum, dancing with the chords. The Kim-inspired We Cry Together stages a noxious melodrama where Kendrick and Zola star Taylour Paige trade barbs that feel almost improvised despite being tightly rhymed and metered. Eminem can finally retire happy.   His commitment to untidiness extends to the production, which is smooth but askew, rhythms and chords stacked precariously. Many of the songs, most of which have at minimum three producers, seem to split at the seams. On Rich (Interlude), Duval Timothy’s piano lines drift apart and glom back together, rain into vapor into clouds. On Purple Hearts, the drums fall away for the entirety of Ghostface’s stellar verse, strings and splashes of piano shadowing the rapper’s meter. The performances don’t always tap into the lushness of the production, but the beats and occasional R&B sample here and there give the often rambling verses some much-needed shape.  Kendrick meanders to the album’s high points, stopping for strange and goofy hot takes on cancel culture, a neuron-melting non-issue that explains literally no rich and famous person’s actual life. His candor turns pugilistic on N95 and Worldwide Steppers, tracks that find him praising Oprah’s moxie (Say what I want about you niggas, I’m like Oprah, dawg) and lamenting a time he paid for unhealthy catering. I am not for the faint of heart, he says after a preamble by Kodak Black, whose inclusion here and throughout the album brings to mind DaBaby and Marilyn Manson’s appearances on Donda. It’s unclear whether his presence is meant to make a case for redemption or musical kinship.  Kendrick’s verse, rapped in the tight pockets of a throbbing vamp, steamrolls into trolling lines that detail vengeful hookups with white women that might be described as Ice Cube’s Cave Bitch meets Eldridge Cleaver’s Soul on Ice. The bars aren’t particularly inflammatory in the context of the song, which casts Kendrick’s Becky cravings as one fiber in the global tapestry of imperfect people who deny and sidestep their flaws. But Kendrick clearly gets a kick out of needling the listener, a current that runs through the album. As his ribbing starts to feel empty—Hello, crackers! (Savior), A celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool (Rich Spirit)—the stated purpose of his venting grows shaky. Is his goal to be honest or impish? Does he want to bare his soul or his fangs?  On Auntie Diaries, the tale of two relatives whose experiences with gender shaped his accountability to family, he attempts the former but fumbles into the latter. In trying to impart a lesson about how he learned then unlearned to say the f-slur, he makes himself the main character in his queer relatives’ stories and he uses the slur wantonly. Few rap listeners will be new to the word and his intentions are clear, but aren’t there other stories he can tell about the trans people in his life? Kendrick has never been a perfect character actor, but in the past he at least imbued roles with some mark of individuality. Compared to Jay-Z’s Smile, which manages to tell the story of Hov’s mom coming out of the closet and mixes flexes and intimacy, Auntie Diaries lacks depth.  On the penultimate track, Mother I Sober, Kendrick finally responds at length to Whitney’s initial assignment. Dropping his voice to a teary murmur, he relates a bleak tale of domestic and familial violence that ensnared himself, cousins, and his mother. Instead of lurid details, the story pivots on stony silences that exile everyone to the confines of their minds, where they bottle up pain instead of processing it. I wish I was somebody/Anybody but myself, Portishead’s Beth Gibbons murmurs for the hook, her ghostly timbre capturing the dissociation the violence has wrought. The song ends with singer Sam Dew crooning, I bare my soul and now we’re free, a tidy conclusion that provokes more questions than it answers. But the song at least has a mission and a through line, and Kendrick labors to probe his feelings and hangups, a sense of effort lacking elsewhere on the album.  Despite all its aggrieved poses and statements, the often astonishing rapping, the fastidious attention to detail, and its theme of self-affirmation, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers ironically never settles on a portrait of Kendrick. Perhaps that slipperiness is the thrust of the album, which might be read as his answer to a question he asked a decade ago, before he was anointed as hip-hop’s conscience: If I mentioned all my skeletons, would you jump in the seat? That fear of being defined by trauma and shame resonates throughout, but Kendrick and his blemishes are so defined by negation—of white gazes, of Black Twitter, of weighty listener expectations—that by the time the record ends, Kendrick’s me is just as nebulous as the effigy he’s spent the album burning. Gods are born in vacuums.
Pitchfork;DAMN. is a widescreen masterpiece of rap, full of expensive beats, furious rhymes, and peerless storytelling about Kendrick’s destiny in America. Life is one funny motherfucker, it’s true. DUCKWORTH., the last song on Kendrick Lamar's fourth studio album DAMN., tells a winding story about Anthony from Compton and Ducky from Chicago, whose paths cross first over KFC biscuits, and again, 20 years later, when Ducky’s son records a song about the encounter for Anthony’s record label. It’s a precious origin story, the stuff of rock docs and hood DVDs, and it’s delivered with such precision, vivid detail, and masterful pacing that it can’t possibly be true. But it’s a tale too strange to be fiction, and too powerful not to believe in—just like its author. Kendrick Lamar has proven he’s a master storyteller, but he’s been saving his best plot twist this whole time, waiting until he was ready, or able, to pull it off. Storytelling has been Lamar’s greatest skill and most primary mission, to put into (lots of) words what it's like to grow up as he did—to articulate, in human terms, the intimate specifics of daily self-defense from your surroundings. Somehow, he’s gotten better. The raps on his fourth studio album DAMN. jab mercilessly like a sewing machine. His boyish nasal instrument is distinct and inimitable as it slithers up and down in pitch on PRIDE. Even when Lamar sounds like Eminem, or Drake, or OutKast, he sounds like himself, and he arguably outpaces them all as a writer. On FEAR., he relays daily threats from his mom (I’ll beat your ass, keep talking back/I’ll beat your ass, who bought you that? You stole it) and from his neighbors (I’ll probably die because I ain’t know Demarcus was snitching/I’ll probably die at these house parties fucking with bitches) over low-slung blues stirred by The Alchemist. Lamar’s recitation is so effortless you wonder where he breathes, or if he does at all.  Kendrick is a relic of the mid-aughts rap blog era, where bedroom WordPress pages would post .zips of albums by amateurs. After years of such releases, Kendrick dropped a self-titled EP in 2009 that featured Big Pooh from Little Brother and elicited such Nah Right comments as I like the beats on this and who da fuk? Accolades swelled with each project, by 2011, he was considering signing with Dr. Dre, by 2013, he was playing SNL and touring with Kanye West. He came of age with his fans, and by 2015’s To Pimp a Butterfly, he put to music their chest-clenched frustrations. Ever the curtain-puller, he released an album of untitled and unmastered drafts and grew his hair out. His short absence, even after lending Taylor Swift a verse, has been made to feel longer by his media shyness and a surging tide of new rappers shuttled out daily.  Throughout it all, he’s avoided the boxed-in fates of predecessors like Nas and peers like J. Cole through an electric originality and curiosity. He mastered rap not for mastery’s sake, but to use it as a form, undeterred by slow-eared fans who’ll only highlight his simplest lines. His best new trick is repetition, it offsets his density and drills his ideas, as enthralling as a Sunday sermon or pre-fight chirp session. There have been few threats committed to record as sincere as, Let somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman/Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother—you tick down the list along with him, slot in your own lifelong bonds with loved ones. Such internal processing plays out through the album’s Greek chorus, via the singer Bēkon, who speaks in riddles of balance throughout: Is it wickedness, is it weakness, Love’s gonna get you killed, but pride’s gonna be the death of you, It was always me versus the world/Until I found it’s me versus me.  DAMN. is best in these philosophical spaces. It lags slightly around the center, where the concept loosens: LOYALTY., with Rihanna, has all the makings of a radio mainstay this summer, and is as low-stakes as the platform demands, it’s always fun to hear Rih rap, and her presence is its most interesting aspect. LUST. would sound better if it weren’t next to an ear-worm as tender as LOVE., which slow-dances between Zacari falsettos and Lamar’s sheepish read of the girl who fills him up. Between the two tracks, it’s easy to tell which force is tugging at him harder.  The record’s few lulls succumb to what surrounds them. The springboard bounce of HUMBLE., the war chant of DNA., and hot steel of XXX. show Kendrick in his element, fast and lucid, like Eazy-E with college credits and Mike WiLL beats. The production is taut and clean, but schizophrenic, often splicing two or three loops into a track and swaying between tempos, closer in kin to good kid, m.A.A.d city’s siren-synths than Butterfly’s brass solos. If he was black as the moon on his last album, he’s an Israelite here, refusing to identify himself by the shade of his skin but fluent in the contents of his D.N.A. Butterfly floated along to soften its scathing stance—We hate po-po sounds better over a smooth saxophone—but with so many wack artists in play, what’s the reward for upliftment? Kendrick is so alone at his altitude that when he acknowledges Fox News, let alone Donald Trump, it feels like a favor to them both.  Still, the album exists for DUCKWORTH. It’s the final piece of the TDE puzzle, a homegrown label of Compton natives that happened to deliver the best rapper of his generation. If we’re to believe the song’s last gunshot—and its seamless loop back to track one—much of DAMN. is written from the perspective of a Kendrick Lamar who grew up without a father to guide him away from the sinful temptations outside his home. He bobs in and out of this perspective, but the repeated pledges to loyalty and martyrdom evoke the life and mind of a young gang member who carries his neighborhood flag because no one’s proved to him that he shouldn’t. These choices, Lamar suggests, aren’t pre-determined or innate, but in constant dialogue with and in reaction to their surrounding circumstances. They aren’t above or beneath anyone who can hear his voice. Success and failure choose their subjects at their whim, we’re as grateful as Kendrick for his fate.
Pitchfork;The dense and complex follow-up to Good Kid, M.A.A.D City is wry, theatrical, chaotic, ironic, and mournful, often all at once. Kendrick Lamar’s major-label albums play out like Spike Lee films in miniature. In both artists’ worlds, the stakes are unbearably high, the characters’ motives are unclear, and morality is knotty, but there is a central force you can feel steering every moment. The Good and Bad Hair musical routine from Lee’s 1988 feature School Daze depicted Black women grappling with colorism and exclusionary standards of American beauty. Mookie’s climactic window smash in 1989’s Do the Right Thing plunged its characters into fiery bedlam, quietly prophesying the coming L.A. riots in the process. In these moments, you could feel the director speaking to you directly through his characters and their trajectories. Lamar’s records, while crowded with conflicting ideas and arguing voices, have a similar sense of a guiding hand at work. Lamar’s new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, doesn’t explicitly bill itself as a movie like Good Kid, M.A.A.D City did, but the network of interlocking dramas explored here feels filmic nonetheless, and a variety of characters appear across the album’s expanse. The opener, Wesley’s Theory, turns the downfall of action-star-turned-convicted-tax-dodger Wesley Snipes into a kind of Faustian parable. Snoop drops by on Institutionalized, Dre himself phones in on Wesley. The mood is wry, theatrical, chaotic, ironic, and mournful, often all at once: On For Free? (Interlude) an impatient woman ticks off a laundry list of material demands before Kendrick snaps back that This dick ain’t free! and thunders through a history of Black oppression, spoken-word style, as if to say, This money you crave, it’s blood money. The album is dotted with surreal grace notes, like a parable: God appears in the guise of a homeless man in How Much a Dollar Cost, and closer Mortal Man ends on a lengthy, unnerving fever-dream interview with the ghost of 2Pac.  The music, meanwhile, follows a long line of genre-busting freakouts (The Roots’ Phrenology, Common’s Electric Circus, Q-Tip’s Kamaal the Abstract, André 3000’s The Love Below) in kicking at the confines of rap music presentation. There’s half a jazz band present at all times, pianist Robert Glasper, producer/sax player Terrace Martin and bass wizard Thundercat give Butterfly a loose, fluid undertow every bit as tempestuous and unpredictable as the army of flows at Kendrick’s disposal. The rapper’s branching out, too, exploding into spastic slam poetry on For Free?, switching from shouty gymnastics to drunken sobs on U and even effecting the lilt of a caring mother on You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Momma Said). It turns out Kendrick’s new direction was every direction at once.  Despite all this, he’s still toying with a narrative on the sly: Just beneath the surface lies a messianic yarn about avoiding the wiles of a sultry girl named Lucy who’s secretly a physical manifestation of the devil. Kendrick refuses to dole out blame without accepting any, however, and on the chaotic free jazz excursion U he turns a mirror on himself, screaming, Loving you is complicated! and suggesting his fame hasn’t helped his loved ones back home. Kendrick’s criticisms, as they did on Good Kid, come with powerful, self-imposed challenges. As Bilal quips on the chorus to Institutionalized: Shit don’t change until you get up and wash your ass, nigga.  Kendrick’s principle of personal responsibility has treaded dangerously close to respectability politics lately, especially after a prickly remark about the Mike Brown shooting in a recent Billboard interview that seemed to pin the death on the victim, but To Pimp a Butterfly avoids that trap. (Mostly.) Complexion (A Zulu Love) is a tender note of appreciation for women of all skin tones with help from North Carolina rapper Rapsody (whose slickly referential guest verse contains a nod to Good and Bad Hair). This is an album about tiny quality of life improvements to be made in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. It might not be the message we want in a year where systemic police and judicial inequality have cost many the ultimate price, but that doesn’t bankrupt it of value.  To Pimp a Butterfly pivots on the polarizing lead single, I. Upon release last autumn, the sunny soul pep talk came off lightweight and glib. When it appears deep in the back end of Butterfly, though, I plays less like the jingle we heard last year and more like the beating heart of the matter. To push the point, the album opts for a live-sounding mix that ditches out midway through, giving way to a speech from the rapper himself. In tone, the speech is not unlike the legendary 1968 concert where James Brown waved off security and personally held off a Boston audience’s fury after news broke that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated. How many niggas we done lost, bro? Kendrick shouts over the crowd. It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left. Underneath the tragedy and adversity, To Pimp a Butterfly is a celebration of the audacity to wake up each morning to try to be better, knowing it could all end in a second, for no reason at all.
Pitchfork;Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d city is fearless and brilliant, an unvarnished and nuanced peek into the rapper's inner life that ties straightforward rap thrills directly to its narrative. The first sound we hear on good kid, m.A.A.d. city is a prayer: Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving us with your precious blood, voices murmur, evoking a family dinner gathering. The album's cover art, a grubby Polaroid, provides a visual prompt for the scene: Baby Kendrick dangles off an uncle's knee in front of a squat kitchen table displaying a 40-ounce and Lamar's baby bottle. The snapshot is such an unvarnished peek into the rapper's inner life that staring at it for too long feels almost invasive. This autobiographical intensity is the album's calling card. Listening to it feels like walking directly into Lamar's childhood home and, for the next hour, growing up alongside him. Lamar has subtitled the record A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar, and the comparison rings true: You could take the album's outline and build a set for a three-act play. It opens on a 17-year-old Kendrick with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental, driving his mother's van to see a girl named Sherane. As his voice darts and halts in a rhythm that mimics his over-eager commute, Lamar explores the furtiveness of young lust: It's deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb, he raps. The song is interrupted by the first of several voice mail recordings that delineate the album's structure: Kendrick's mother, rambling into his phone and pleading for him to return her car. These voicemails appear through the record, reinforcing that good kid, m.A.A.d city is partly a love letter to the grounding power of family. In this album's world, family and faith are not abstract concepts: They are the fraying tethers holding Lamar back from the chasm of gang violence that threatens to consume him.  All this weighty material might make good kid, m.A.A.d city sound like a bit of a drag. But the miracle of this album is how it ties straightforward rap thrills-- dazzling lyrical virtuosity, slick quotables, pulverizing beats, star turns from guest rappers-- directly to its narrative. For example, when Backseat Freestyle leaked last week, its uncharacteristic subject matter (All my life I want money and power/ Respect my mind or die from lead shower) took some fans by surprise. But on the album, it marks the moment in the narrative when young Kendrick's character first begins rapping, egged on by a friend who plugs in a beat CD. Framed this way, his damn, I got bitches chant gets turned inside out: This isn't an alpha male's boast. It's a pipsqueak's first pass at a chest-puff. It's also a monster of a radio-ready single, with Kendrick rapping in three voices (in double- and triple-time, no less) over an insane Hit-Boy beat.  Lamar grew up in Compton, and ghosts of West Coast gangsta-rap haunt this album's edges, casting shadows on Kendrick's complicated relationship with his hometown. When The Art of Peer Pressure brings Kendrick and his friends to Rosecrans Ave., the music downshifts into menacing G-funk mode as a salute to hallowed ground. Ice Cube’s Bird in the Hand is invoked to set up m.A.A.d city (Fresh of out school, 'cause I was a high-school grad...), which appropriately marks the moment when real violence erupts. Here, Kendrick sounds like a terrified kid: I made a promise to see you bleeding, he raps, his voice pitched at a pleading, near-hysterical sob. In response, the voice of Compton's Most Wanted rapper MC Eiht leers, Wake yo' punk ass up, like a father figure of the Darth Vader variety.  Which brings us to the album's most visible benefactor and most unsettled presence: Dr. Dre. In recent months, Dre has availed himself of the fresh-career oxygen Kendrick's rise has pumped into his atmosphere, lumbering out of his corporate airlock to stand with Lamar on magazine covers. But the role he plays in Lamar's story feels muddled and unresolved. On an album that manages to seamlessly work a smirking Drake and a highly recognizable Janet Jackson sample (Poetic Justice) into the fabric of a larger narrative, it is only Dre's appearance, on the final track Compton, that feels like an uneasy outlier.  Compton is the victory lap, the coronation. Coming after the stunning 12-minute denouement Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst, in which Lamar delivers a verse from a peripheral character that is the album's most dazzling stroke of empathy, it can't help but be a small deflation. The moment of arrival in any artist's story is always less interesting than their journey, and there's a disconnect in hearing Lamar and Dre stunt over Just Blaze's blaring orchestral-soul beat. Dre's music is part of the landscape that Kendrick grew up in but his actual appearance has a certain Truman Show feel to it.  But the true ending of good kid, m.A.A.d. city takes place at the end of the previous song, Real, which represents the spiritual victory that the album's story has thrashed its way towards. Finally grasping that none of that shit-- money, power, respect, loving your block-- make me real, Lamar embraces what does, as his parents put the album's central concerns to bed: Any nigga can kill a man, his father admonishes. That don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. And his mother: If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man... Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton... When you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement. And that's the best way to give back to your city. And I love you, Kendrick.
Pitchfork;The rising country star from Oklahoma works with a traditionalist’s appreciation for songwriting and the intense, earnest emotion of heartland rock. Four songs into his very ambitious, very serious self-titled album, Zach Bryan anticipates some criticism. Do you ever get tired of singin’ songs/Like all your pain is just another fuckin’ singalong? he asks in East Side of Sorrow, one of the record’s many full-throated singalongs about a painful subject. By this point in the record, the 27-year-old songwriter has already recited a poem about the nature of fear and included a brief electric guitar interpolation of The Star-Spangled Banner, he’s shared a stark reflection on a road trip with a sick loved one and delved into his past as a Navy vet, rhyming fight a war with don’t even know what you’re fighting for. It sounds heavy—and it is heavy. So why does Zach Bryan feel like a breath of fresh air? For all his high-stakes musings on life and love and death, sung in a gruff, boyish howl that makes even just the word child sound like a stifled sob, Bryan has a lot of fight in him. A growing force on both the country and rock charts, he is a reluctant celebrity whose reluctance only makes him seem more like a celebrity, all while maintaining a focus on songwriting as a pure, unfiltered outlet for telling his story. I’m too writing-driven to be a big star, he told The New York Times last year. I’m not meant for it. And while he was being interviewed about American Heartbreak, his platinum-selling, star-making, 34-song major-label debut, he does have a point. Self-produced and written almost entirely without co-writers, his follow-up, Zach Bryan, lives proudly in its own world, for better or worse.  Listening to Bryan’s songs, it’s clear why he’s thriving on country radio. Even with his stripped-back arrangements, he’s got a knack for memorable, meaty hooks that take you down the backroads beside him with the radio blasting. This gift is especially evident in Hey Driver, whose chorus about small towns and fine women is so big and fun that guest vocalist Michael Trotter Jr. of the War and Treaty can’t seem to stop belting the harmony part, getting louder and more soulful with each repetition. By the end of the song, Bryan has muted his own delivery to an uncharacteristic speak-sing, seemingly distracted by the effect his melodies have on the people around him. You can picture him closing his eyes tightly, imagining how it will feel when the whole crowd joins in.  In moments like these, Bryan sounds like a pop star, but he still works firmly in the lineage of old-school country songwriting. Just the opening verse of I Remember Everything, a winning ballad featuring Kacey Musgraves, alludes to rotgut whiskey and an ’88 Ford, daddy and mama, and the inherited wisdom that grown men don’t cry. Raised in Oologah, Oklahoma, Bryan never tires of surveying the emotional landscape of his childhood and the effect it’s had on his young adulthood. From his time in the Navy to his unlikely ascent on the charts to the death of his mother in 2016, he has become a master at casting the facts of his life as hard-won pep talks: The proper opener, Overtime, is a rousing and self-aware underdog anthem, incorporating the closest thing this album has to a joke with a sample from a recent Barstool Sports fan interview. And yet occasionally Bryan stumbles when placing himself in a larger narrative about old souls in a modern world: I wish I was a tradesman, he tries late in the album, learning from some beat-down old layman.  For all his traditionalism, Bryan is equally outspoken about what he doesn’t like about country music. He was one of the genre’s only major figures to criticize Morgan Wallen for being racist in the immediate aftermath, and compared to the slick sound of his contemporaries, he prefers the tender setting of live takes and four-track demos. He’s fond of the way his voice sounds clipping in the mic, how the strings of his guitar resonate after the other instruments die out, and how studio banter can give the effect of an impromptu jam session. The wistful closing tracks, Smaller Acts and Oklahoman Son, could be hits, but the recordings are too lo-fi to find a home on mainstream radio, opting for a scratchy setting to suit his tone of tearful remembrance. From the cozy tape hiss to the muted trumpets throughout, you get the sense that Bryan holds a copy of For Emma, Forever Ago very close to his heart.  This earnest intensity is Bryan’s default setting—a quality that puts him closer to angsty young heartland rockers like Sam Fender rather than fellow country chart-toppers like Luke Combs. As he expands his sound beyond genre confines, he can sell a multi-part epic like Jake’s Piano - Long Island and a complexly orchestrated slow-burner like Ticking. But he doesn’t yet have the same range in his writing, lyrically or melodically. In one song he rails against acts who compose songs about nothing and others fueled by backdoor deals and therapy, and Bryan’s obsession with raw, unprocessed emotion sometimes boxes him into a dour, one-dimensional sound. The overall effect of his records can be like binging an entire season of a network drama: one dramatic gesture after another, all delivered with the same minor-to-major gravitas, all gunning for the same emotional response. When he sings a chorus of I ain’t spotless/Neither is you, accompanied by the Lumineers, the sentiment feels so meaningless that it might as well come from the same Nashville assembly line that Bryan stands so proudly against.  In the place of these swings toward grand, everyman resonance, I sometimes long for any hint of the renegade spirit of Bryan’s stance against unfair ticket prices, or the irreverent righteousness of calling his first live album All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster. This is why it’s such a relief midway through the record when he enlists his band for Fear and Friday’s. They settle on a lighter, looser mood to navigate the album’s themes of desperate nights and broken promises—more The River than Nebraska. I’ve got a fear, dear, that it’s gonna end, Bryan sings in the chorus. Won’t you get angry at me/Say you love me again? In Bryan’s songs, these big emotions—love and anger, hope and fear—are all tangled up, and getting crushed by their waves is always preferable to feeling nothing at all. If Zach Bryan brings this approach near a breaking point, the fierce determination also ends up being his saving grace. Whatever effect his songs have on you, there’s never any doubt they’re coming from the heart.
Pitchfork;The country crossover star’s excellent songwriting is raw and evocative, and though he continues to hone his sound, the total emotional experience of the album sometimes wears a bit thin. Some songwriters have a direct line from their open wounds to the pen on the page, and then there’s Zach Bryan. His 2019 self-produced, self-released debut album, DeAnn, was named after his mother, who died of complications related to alcoholism when Bryan was 20. Recorded during his time as an aviation ordnanceman in the Navy, its ragged songs detail grief and regret, devotion that leads to violence, family curses and hard-won redemption. Bryan’s passion and pathos garnered him a cult following that turned him into a stadium-filling superstar, and though he now records and travels with a full band—not to mention guest stars like Maggie Rogers, Bruce Springsteen, and the Hawk Tuah girl—his work still carries the stark intensity and emotional bareness of a heart-to-heart with a stranger after one too many beers. His new album, The Great American Bar Scene, adds to the Zach Bryan formula by taking on a wider lens, weaving his personal struggles and triumphs into the greater legacy of lost souls and camaraderie found in America’s watering holes. This can lead to exciting new lyrical territory for him, like on Oak Island, a tightly wound character song about a railroad worker whose brother’s gotten into trouble with some boys from New Jersey. His protagonist, Mickey, also appears on the title track—this time as a nod to malt liquor—in a story that starts off with getting played by a bookie from Philly, winds through a police chase in Cheyenne, and ends with swaying to Johnny Cash with some sweet young thing under neon lights. In the background, you can hear the ambient sound of balls clanking in a game of pool, timed to the strums of the guitar.  It’s all very Nebraska, a comparison that’s hung over Bryan since his early lo-fi releases. He even tries to get ahead of the punchline here, with references to State Trooper and Reason to Believe and a duet with the Boss himself on Sandpaper. Ironically, the sound of Bar Scene is the most full-bodied of Bryan’s career, building upon the heartland rock that he explored in his 2022 major-label breakthrough American Heartbreak and the self-titled follow-up from last year. Bryan makes the kind of production choices here associated with someone gaining a lot more money and creative control in a short amount of time, deploying mariachi horns, gospel choirs and, yes, a John Mayer guitar solo to complete his vision. They mostly work, though maybe not surprisingly, Bryan’s folksier instincts shine the most: the moments of lonesome pedal steel and guitar-pickin’, the skilled harmonies with Noeline Hofmann on Purple Gas, and the showstopping harmonica on Pink Skies. That song, an account of DeAnn’s funeral, is so meticulously constructed that you can see exactly why, against all odds, it was picked as the album’s lead single.  Bryan has expressed stubbornness, even pride, in continuing to release albums that extend past an hour. While the drawn-out onslaught of emotions can set up a uniquely cathartic experience, it starts to wear thin on Bar Scene, where well-crafted tracks bump up against half-baked ghosts of past Bryan songs. Bass Boat sounds like an attempt at recapturing the magic of the two-part ballad Jake’s Piano - Long Island from last year, but apart from one particularly devastating line—I was raised by a woman who was hardly impressed/And I carry that shit real deep in my chest—it never quite reaches the same heights. Bryan sometimes trades jarring specificity for more general platitudes, such as, Don’t get angry, listen to the sounds/Them good times will find their way back around, on Better Days. Even when he gets into the details, he tends to lean on nostalgic signifiers—Beale Street and Elvis quotes, old Fords and Tom & Jerry, Trans-Am and Kodachrome—in place of more substantive meaning.  There have been many comparisons made between Bryan and Morgan Wallen, the other streaming giant of country music, unabashedly more conservative than Bryan but also a fan of long albums, wistful reminiscing, and authentic presentation. But there are arguably many more similarities between him and Tyler Childers, the Appalachian singer-songwriter whom Bryan shouts out on the very last line of Bar Scene, or Colter Wall, the gruff-voiced plainsman from Saskatchewan, whose song Motorcycle Bryan recently covered on his Instagram Story. All three of these men combine a reverence for country traditionalism with the outlaw attitude of the 1970s, to the extent where, when Bryan rails against 808s infiltrating the country charts on Bathwater, it feels redundant.  But if artists like Bryan can match, or even surpass, the stardom of Nashville’s revolving door of country-pop singers, then what exactly is he rallying against? Bryan is now, reluctantly or not, the biggest crossover success in the industry, long past the point of being able to call himself an underdog. I’m a mechanical bull, throw a quarter and watch me go, he mutters, with a shrug, early on Bar Scene. You get the sense that, if given the chance, Bryan would fast-forward through all this fame business and become a barroom staple, with the kind of songs that people sing along to because their parents did. Only time will tell if he ever reaches that point, as Bryan would know, it takes a few decades to earn a permanent spot in the jukebox.

Pitchfork;On his fourth album, Justin Vernon reassembles the familiar Bon Iver elements like a cubist collage, with his voice fearlessly front and center. The result is his most honest and forthright music ever. Bon Iver has always been Justin Vernon’s escape route. After retreating to the woods of Wisconsin to record For Emma, Forever Ago, he drew a surrealist roadmap of the United States on Bon Iver, depicting a fantastical world where the lived, the dreamed, and desired coexisted. When this invented land felt oppressive and the anxiety of facing it too overwhelming, Vernon retreated again and burrowed within himself, pulverizing his voice with machines to create 22, A Million, a record that dramatized the fracturing of the self. There’s no more hiding on i,i. Justin Vernon takes the Bon Iver sound and reassembles it like a cubist collage, with his voice right out front. All the familiar elements are here—impressionist swells of sound, impenetrable-yet-tender lyrics, mesmerizing studio tricks—and they are buoyed by Vernon’s supple baritone, the instrument he knows how to manipulate best. Acoustic guitar, horns, and piano return to prominence alongside the jittery electronics and synths that Vernon has lately favored. But the mood he conjures with these elements feels new. These songs don’t swallow you whole with grandeur, they look outward, leaving some room for the rest of the world.  The lyrics find Vernon locating peace within the ordinary and everyday. I like you/And that ain’t nothing new, he sings simply on iMi. Later, on RABi, he observes, Well, it’s all just scared of dying. These things don’t always merit saying out loud, but Vernon seems to be singing them to rediscover their meaning, and the music feels equally straightforward and searching. Songs like Marion and Holyfields, are uncharacteristically unadorned, even compared to the For Emma and Blood Bank era, when Vernon was at least joined by his own echoes. Here, he sounds completely exposed.  Still, there are plenty of invited guests to provide cover, or at least offer their company. James Blake, Moses Sumney, and Wye Oak’s Jenn Wasner, among others, pop up throughout. Even Young Thug collaborator Wheezy has composing and production credits. Vernon sampled the voices of others on 22, A Million, but in that context they felt more like dolls he’d animated than human beings. The guests on i,i, meanwhile, are allowed to breathe. Bruce Hornsby might sing only one line on the single U (Man Like), but his presence is enlivening. It’s less lonely to have friends nearby.  Vernon himself sings with more texture and conviction than ever before. He’s shifted fully from vessel to commander, steering the music instead of seeping into it. A song like Naeem is filled with production flourishes—a soft backing choir, faint samples, the sort of military drums favored on Bon Iver’s Perth—yet it all serves to highlight the booming sound of Vernon’s voice, bellowing in his natural range. The lyrics to Naeem are dizzying and, at points, indecipherable (I fall off a bass boat/And the concrete’s very slow), but he isn’t hiding behind them. It’s more like Vernon is suggesting that only feeling can offer truth. On Naeem, he sings, Tell them I’ll be passing on/Tell them we’re young mastodons, dragging his words in the second line until you can almost hear him choking up. Like all the best moments in his catalog, it is inexplicably touching.  i,i is often about trying to reconnect with some idea of a true self, even as you move forward. Vernon writes of scars and things lost: You were young when you were gave it, he sings on We, a line that speaks to his ability to summon powerful elegiac feelings with a few simple words. Hey, Ma, immediately one of the best songs in the Bon Iver catalog, is rousing and explicitly sentimental. Full time you talk your money up/While it’s living in a coal mine, Vernon belts, but his voice is too earthy to sound hateful. Instead, it’s like he’s offering absolution, promising that something as simple as a call to your mom is enough to make up for avarice or bluster.  At first glance, the tracklist for i,i is as bewildering as the symbol-laden 22, A Million. Upon listening, though, you realize that many of these are probably mondegreens and homonyms, cheeky nods to how hard it is to understand Bon Iver’s lyrics. Jelmore, for instance, is a fragment of what it sounds like when Vernon sings, Well angel morning sivanna. And the title for the closing RABi comes from the couplet, I could prophet/I could rob I, however. There are plenty of interpretive possibilities available in those words, but none of them are as enticing as their sheer sound. The music is also not as mysterious as the songs’ monikers suggest. There’s an overwhelming calmness and pleasantness to i,i, and RABi is one of the most easygoing of the bunch. Sunlight feels good now don’t it, Vernon sings. There’s no great symbolism in the track, no yearning, no enveloping echoes. What emerges is a solace that has eluded Vernon on past Bon Iver releases. I don’t have a leaving plan, he sings, maybe because there’s nowhere else he needs to go.
